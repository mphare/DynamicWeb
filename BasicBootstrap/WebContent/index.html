			<p class="text-center text-success">Declaration of Independence</p>
			<p class="text-left">When in the Course of human events, it
				becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands
				which have connected them with another, and to assume among the
				powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the
				Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to
				the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes
				which impel them to the separation.</p>
			<p class="text-right">We hold these truths to be self-evident,
				that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their
				Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life,
				Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.</p>
			<p class="text-justify">That to secure these rights, Governments
				are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the
				consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government
				becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to
				alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its
				foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such
				form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and
				Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long
				established should not be changed for light and transient causes;
				and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more
				disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right
				themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But
				when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the
				same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute
				Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such
				Government, and to provide new Guards for their future
				security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies;
				and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their
				former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of
				Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all
				having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny
				over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid
				world.</p>
